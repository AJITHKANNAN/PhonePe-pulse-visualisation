This project involves processing and visualizing data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. This is a multi-step project that involves data extraction, transformation, storage, and visualization. 
I'll provide you with a high-level overview of the steps you need to take to accomplish each of these tasks:

**Step 1: Data Extraction**
To extract data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, you will need to use scripting to clone the repository. You can use the Git command-line tool or a Git library in your chosen programming language (such as Python's gitpython) to automate this process.

**Step 2: Data Transformation and Pre-processing**

After cloning the repository, you will likely encounter raw data files that might not be in a suitable format for analysis. Depending on the structure of the data, you'll need to write scripts to transform and preprocess it into a usable format. This could involve cleaning up messy data, handling missing values, and organizing the data into a structured format for storage.

**Step 3: Insert Data into MySQL Database**

For efficient storage and retrieval of the transformed data, you can set up a MySQL database. You'll need to design an appropriate database schema that fits the structure of your data. Use a database library (such as MySQL Connector for Python) to connect to the MySQL server and insert the data into the respective tables.

**Step 4: Create Geo Visualization Dashboard**

To create an interactive visualization dashboard, you can use Python libraries like Streamlit and Plotly. Streamlit allows you to create web applications with minimal effort, while Plotly provides versatile charting capabilities. You'll need to design the layout of the dashboard and create interactive elements such as dropdowns, buttons, and maps.

**Step 5: Fetch Data from MySQL for Dashboard**

In the Streamlit app, use SQL queries (via the MySQL Connector) to fetch the data from the MySQL database. You'll want to retrieve the data based on the user's selected filters and criteria. Transform the fetched data into Plotly visualizations that can be embedded into your Streamlit app.

**Step 6: Dropdown Options for Users**

Create at least 10 different dropdown options that users can select to dynamically change the data displayed on the dashboard. These dropdowns could include various metrics, time ranges, geographical regions, and any other relevant categories that provide insights into the data.

**Additional Considerations:**

*Ensure proper error handling at each step of the process.
*Regularly update the data by scheduling periodic repository updates and database refreshes.
*Optimize database queries for performance, especially if dealing with a large dataset.
*Pay attention to user experience design to make the dashboard intuitive and visually appealing.
*Remember that each step of this process requires coding and familiarity with relevant libraries and tools. 

**Good luck, Guys!**
